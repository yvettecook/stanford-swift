Week 1:

Long-ish intro, slow start for mid-level, but using setting up of W2.


Week 2:

Some nice refactoring of `operate` switch statement, introducing functions as first class objects and using anonymous functions (closures).

MVC explanation also good.

W1 & W2 reading probably only appropriate for beginners?
